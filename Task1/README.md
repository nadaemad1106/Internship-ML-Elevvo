# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction  

This task is part of my **ML Internship (Elevvo)**.  
I built a regression model to predict **student exam scores** using study-related factors.  

### Steps:
- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling).  
- EDA (visualizations + correlations + feature importance).  
- Models: **Linear Regression** (baseline), **Polynomial Regression**, and **feature experiments**.  

### Results:
- Linear Regression: ~76% accuracy (RÂ²).  
- Polynomial Regression: ~74% accuracy.  
- Feature experimentation showed how removing some factors changes performance.
